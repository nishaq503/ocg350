\section{Fishing}
\label{sec:fishing}

We have already shown food webs and associated diet matrices both with and without the human activity of fishing.
We solved the linear system for each food web and use Figure~\ref{fig:bar-plots} to show the consumption by each participating species.

As can be seen, fishing on Shrimp and Lobsters barely effects them.
Tuna and Marlin see a moderate effect due to fishing.
There is also a noticeable effect on sharks.
This is surprising because, in our model, humans do not eat sharks.
This can be explained by the fact that humans are competing directly against sharks for most of the sharks' food.

Upon including humans, this model does not agree with the sharp population declines we see in real life.
Perhaps we need to adjust consumption fractions separately for each species that humans fish for this model to better reflect the decline in populations.
